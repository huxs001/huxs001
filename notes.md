## Why

As you may guess, this is not my main account.

It seems to be a culture that programmers from the Central Country use only nicknames on social medias, 
and communicate with everyone that does not know its name.  
You just know why.

However, when it comes to a cooperation with person that knows my name, it will be, confusing.

This is why my formal name come to be exists in this website.  
And of course, the usage of this account will be minimal, as long as, you know why.
